Next, we will begin the design and development phases of
our project. After we present our research findings, we will
hold a visioning session with our clients at the NASA Ames
Research Center in Mountain View, CA.
Once we generate more visions and agree upon
a focused direction, our team will develop several
iterative prototypes. After each prototype
is created, we will conduct field tests with real
users at NASAâ€™s test facilities. Field testing and
analysis of those results will inform our next
iterations of prototypes, helping us to improve
the quality and functionality of our designs.
After 3-4 cycles of prototypes and user tests, we
will deliver a final working prototype in early
August 2014.
