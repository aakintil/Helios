                    <p>Our research methods included contextual inquiries (primary) and interviews (secondary). Because we could not observe one of our target users groups, astronauts, in context, we conducted contextual inquiries in four analogous domains: science, test labs, machine shops, and the medical domain. This research method enabled us to understand many aspects of procedure execution, including set up/clean up processes, the tools and reference materials individuals use, tools and materials organization, verification techniques, documentation, and collaboration with coworkers, since we observed individuals in their natural work context. We also conducted interviews to gather additional insights, or when we could not observe individuals for various reasons, such as patient privacy concerns in the medical domain.

                      After each observation, we interpreted our data by creating various models, when appropriate, in order to understand different aspects of procedure execution: </p>
                      <ul>
                        <li> Flow model: shows how information and artifacts flow between entities when they perform a task </li>
                        <li> Sequence model: shows the steps individuals undergo to complete a task </li>
                        <li> Physical model: shows the physical layout of an individual’s workspace </li>
                        <li>Artifact model: shows the physical artifacts that individuals create in order to support their work </li>
                        <li>Cultural model: shows the pressures, norms, and influences that are present in a work environment </li>
                      </ul>
                     <p> Moreover, we created an affinity diagram from our observation and interview notes in order to identify themes in our dataset. Finally, we extracted insights by consolidating our models and identifying high-level themes. 

                      Altogether, we performed 22 (21?) contextual inquiries and 7 interviews, broken down as follows: </p>

                    <div class="ci-sections">
                      <h4>Intro</h4>
                      <p> The medical domain shares many characteristics with the NASA work environment, such as high stakes situations, expensive equipment, and the use of many tools during procedure execution. 
                        Our research included observing an emergency department (ED) nurse at the UPMC and several anesthesiology nurses at the University of Pittsburgh’s WISER Institute, which conducts medical simulations. In addition, we interviewed an anesthesiologist and a pediatric orthopaedic surgeon, both from Stanford University.</p>
                      </div><!-- /.ci-sections -->

                      <div class="ci-sections">
                        <h4> Key Observations </h4>
                        <p class="callout">Tool organization and tracking are done manually </p>
                        <p>Our conversation with the ED nurse revealed the manual tool organization and tracking process used in some hospitals. We anticipated that UPMC would use automated tool management systems such as Teletracking and CenTrack but learned that nurses use a paper checklist to indicate which tools belong and get placed in each room. Moreover, a nurse’s morning routine includes gathering, verifying that she has the right tools, and placing them in the necessary rooms. 
                          Because tool organization and tracking is a manual process, medical organizations have devised ways to make the work less burdensome. For example, some companies that manufacture tool kits sent to hospitals color code similar tools, so that nurses know which ones to group together when they lay them out on the tray. Furthermore, some tool trays have templates in which only certain tools or pieces will fit, which facilitates tools organization. </p>

                          <p class="callout">Standardizing procedures is challenging because of unique physician and patient needs
                          </p>
                          <p>  We also discovered that standardizing procedures can be challenging in healthcare because of unique physician preferences and patient needs. Our interview with the anesthesiologist revealed that, while there are some common tools he uses such as forceps, syringes, and patient status monitoring devices, there’s a lot of variation in tool use depending on one’s subspecialty. Furthermore, standardizing procedures can be difficult in anesthesiology because the types and dosage administered depend on individual patient traits such as weight, age, and history of drug use.
                            However, one area that Stanford’s anesthesiology department has attempted to proceduralize is crisis management. Stanford created a book called the Emergency Manual, which outlines critical cases and high-level steps for how to handle each one if it arises. This is an important reference material during a crisis since our memory worsens, and we may deviate from planned actions, during a stressful situation. </p>

                            <p class="callout">Collaboration breakdowns are caused by poor coordination and inaccurate system information
                            </p>
                            <p> Our observations showed that inter-department collaboration can be inefficient because of poor coordination with colleagues and inaccurate system information. For example, when transferring patients between departments, medical personnel physically hand the patient’s chart to a member of the department using a “safe hand-off”. While this process protects a patient’s safety, it can create inefficiencies when the person who is supposed to receive the patient is not available. Moreover, transferring a patient to another department can be stymied by inaccurate system information. Nurses use a system that indicates whether rooms are open in a department. Because the room statuses are sometimes inaccurate, miscommunication between departments can occur while trying to transfer patients.
                            </p>
                            <p class="callout">Technological solutions are not always appropriate</p>
                            <p>Our interview with the anesthesiologist revealed that technological solutions to problems are not always practical. For example, while presenting the Emergency Manual in traditional book format may seem outdated, technological solutions such as audio dictation don’t work in a noisy environment, nor do tablets or other touchscreen devices if the anesthesiologist is wearing gloves or carrying tools. This reinforces the need to consider the individual’s work context when designing solutions to a problem.

                          <h2> Machine Shops </h2>

                          <div class="ci-sections">
                            <h4>
                              Intro
                            </h4>
                            <p>Machine shops were another work environment that we looked at closely. Machine shops have many characteristics that exist in the NASA environments that we are designing for. Machinists are often asked to create a single specialized part. These one-off tasks are common for NASA personnel because of the unique nature of their work. Another characteristic we hoped to observe was a high stakes environment. The equipment in machine shops can be extremely expensive, and machinist interactions with this equipment is affected by this fact. Finally, machine shops require a high level up upkeep and maintenance. Keeping machines in proper working order is a large part of a machinists job which is also prevalent in the NASA context.We performed a total of six machine shop observations across a variety of industries. We observed three machinists who worked in a machine shop at NASA’s White Sands Test Facility. We also observed machinists working at Specialized Bicycles, Angstrom Sciences, and Carnegie Mellon University.
                            </p>
                          </div>
                          
                          <div class="ci-sections">
                            <h4 style="margin-top: 20px"> Key Observations </h4>
                            <p class="callout">Work Process Differ Based on Preference and Experience</p>
                            <p>During our visits to machine shops we discovered that individual machinists can work in very different ways. Machinists do not usually work from detail procedures documents, but they are often working from part specifications or CAD models they have created. Because machinists are not working from step-by-step procedure documents, their works methods may be very different. If two different machinists are asked to create the same part, they may use completely different tools to create it. We also found out that it is common for machinists to have been working as machinists for many years and are experienced with their work, especially in the NASA context. This also contributes to the fact that they all work differently. Through their experience, they have discovered what works for them and come up with their own workflows.  </p>

                            <p class="callout">Shop Status Information is Necessary and Difficult to Gather</p>
                            <p>Another observation we made is that machinists often need to gather status information. This status information can be anything from the calibration of a tool, to knowing if a CNC mill is working properly. While observing machinists, they would commonly stop everything they were doing and listen very carefully. This is because they detected a change in the noise in the shop and needed to make sure it was not because a machine was working improperly. They stated that they are constantly monitoring for changes in sound and smell that would notify them of changes in status.
                              We also saw that the machinists did not trust the status information provided to them by the machines they were working with. For example, a CNC mill is capable of calibrating itself, but the machinist would manually measure and verify that it was correctly calibrated just incase something went wrong. These machines are expensive, and something as simple as an incorrect calibration could break the machine.</p>

                              <p class="callout">Information is Physically Associated with Materials it Pertains To</p>
                              <p>A common technique for organizing and keeping track of material for machinists was to keep materials and information about them physically close. By doing this a machinist was able to quickly reference information and know exactly which information belonged with which part. We saw this organizational approach in many different forms. For example in one shop, they would store parts and their procedure documents together in a bin. Another shop worked with very small materials so they would keep the parts in small bottles that were labeled with information and specifications about the part inside them. This allowed them to quickly know about the part without having to closely examine it. Finally, in the same shop we saw that they stamped all their flight-grade material with a reference number. This allowed them to look up detail specifications about the part. As well and identify the material with less errors. Similarly, machinists would frequently write numbers for quick reference on sheets of paper and bring them over to their work stations. To keep them organized they would place the part on top of the document. This close spatial relationship was their method of associating bits of information with specific materials, so they could more effectively execute their procedures.
                              </p>
                              <p class="callout">Multitasking and Nested Procedures Occur Frequently</p>
                              <p>Machinists are often working on several different processes at one time. This usually occurs when a machinist sets up a machine, such as a CNC mill, that will automatically run a procedure. The machinist will then go work on a more hands on task, such as working at a lathe. This allows the machinist to be more efficient with their time, but they must very carefully monitor the status of the automated machine to ensure that nothing has broken or gone wrong.
                                Another form of multiple procedure execution we saw was nested procedures. During our observations we often saw a machinist’s work get blocked because a tool or machine was broken or required maintenance. The machinists would have to put their current work on hold, fix the broken equipment, and then proceed with their original objective. We even observed instances where this would happen while already fixing a piece of broken equipment, so two pieces of equipment would need to be repaired to continue working.</p>

                          <h2> Test Laboratories </h2>
                          <!-- section title -->

                          <div class="ci-sections">
                          <h4>Intro</h4>
                          <p>The test laboratory domain was an obvious choice for observations because we are actually designing for NASA test lab environments. In test labs, we expected to discover insights into how tools were identified and tracks, how procedures were carried out, and the juggling of many tasks at once. We primarily focused our attention on the technicians because, similar to astronauts on the ISS, technicians often carry procedures that are written by others and they use and track a large number of tools. 
                          In the test lab domain, we observed four test lab technicians at NASA: two from the White Sands Test Facility in the ArcJet lab, and two at NASA Ames’s Hypervelocity test lab. We also observed two lab technicians at a bicycle company, Specialized Bicycle Components, while they were performing stiffness tests on some bike frames. In both settings, we witnessed collaboration between teammates and the sharing of tools. We also witnessed some process flexibility, depending on the stakes involved. For example, at the bike test lab, lab tech performed a series of tests but determined the order of the tests. However, at the ArcJet lab, the lab techs had to follow a very specific list of procedures that was defined by previous test protocols, client specifications, and directions from a test engineer. In all other cases, the lab techs we observed did not refer to any documented procedures, because they were already familiar with the steps and tools involved.
                          </p>
                          </div>

                          <div class="ci-sections">
                          <h4 style="margin-top: 20px"> Key Observations </h4>
                          <p class="callout">Documents are inadequate for quick reference during procedures</p>
                          <p>At NASA, we observed ArcJet and Hypervelocity lab technicians carrying out routine maintenance procedures that usually did not require them to consult reference documents. In the few occasions when documented procedures was consulted, it usually occurred the setup phase of a procedure. Once a procedure was in process, the lab tech would usually just ask another co-worker for quick reference. Similarly, at the test lab of a bike company, we observed lab techs carrying out procedures that occurred frequently because they were tests based on industry standards. One exception occurred when one lab tech had a crucial measurement that he needed to reference on an Excel spreadsheet. In that case, he had to halt his procedures, walk to his computer, find and load the spreadsheet, just to collect that one piece of data. These observations suggest that detailed documentation are inadequate and inefficient for quick reference in the middle of procedures. </p>

                          <p class="callout">People are often unprepared to collaborate, resulting in breakdowns</p>
                          <p>The biggest breakdown in the test lab domain occurred during the collaboration between the lab tech and their collaborators. In some cases, information was not properly shared between people. For example, at Specialized, one lab tech was performing a series of stiffness tests that were being repeated by other lab techs at a different location. After he completed his procedures, he documented his results and went to check on the results from the other lab, but they had not yet arrived, which prevented him from finishing his procedure. In other cases, a person who is crucial to a procedure step was not present when he was needed. At the Hypervelocity facility, a major delay occurred when the the verifier of one procedure stepped out of the vicinity and could not be reached by intercom or phone. </p>

                          <p class="callout">Short distance collaboration creates inefficiencies</p>
                          <p>At the NASA test facilities, collaboration occurred between lab techs, operators, and test engineers who were often separated by the distances between their work stations. For example, at the ArcJet facility, two lab techs were separated by the ArcJet machine itself -- with one lab tech stationed on one half of the machine and the other stationed on the other side. The volume of noise emitted by the machine, along with its height, made communication between the two lab techs difficult. Furthermore, a third machine operator, who controlled the machine in another room, had to run back and forth between the two rooms in order operate the machine and relay information. At the Hypervelocity test lab, we noticed that the lab techs carried walkie talkies but did not use them, despite the distances between collaborations at their different stations.</p>

                          <p>While lab techs at NASA operated with much higher stakes and less process flexibility, the lab techs are Specialized had a series of tests to perform, and they carried them out in the order that they deemed most efficient. For one series of tests, a lab tech had to perform 3 different tests on 3 different sizes of bike frames. The setup for each test involved 2-3 minutes of removing one frame and fascining the next frame to the workstation. Rather than going through this process once and performing all three tests for each bike, the lab tech opted to perform one test at a time but take the extra time to change the frames. Based on this observation, we believe that taking more time to perform physical steps are preferred to constantly changing mental models.
